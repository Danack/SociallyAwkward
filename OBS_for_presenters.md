# OBS for presenters

So....streaming content is quite easy with OBS. Setting up OBS is also easy, if you have a list to follow. So here is a list


## Download OBS

Go to https://obsproject.com/ and install it


## Install virtual cam plugin

This allows you to use the output of OBS as a virtual webcam, which allows you to use it in chat rooms.

## Start OBS and get configuring

OBS allows you to setup 'scenes'. Each scene can have multiple inputs, which you then choose how they get composited into the output.

People presenting need two scenes. 


## Create slides scene

### Add a source of your slides

The easiest way to do this is with Windows capture. Add that as a source, and then configur it to look at the window where your slides are. It should default to being full screen for your output.

### Add a source of your camera

Move it to be a small rectangle in the bottom right.


## Configure virtualcam output 


Todo - how to do this.
